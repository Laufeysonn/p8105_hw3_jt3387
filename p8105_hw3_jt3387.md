library(p8105.datasets)
```

## Problem 1

Load the dataset:

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart = instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

Brief discription of the dataset:

-   This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

-   The dataset contains following variables:
    `order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department`,
    and some key variables are: `order_id` represents the order
    identifier, `product_id` represents the product identifier,
    `user_id` represents the customer identifier, `aisle_id` represents
    the aisle identifier, `department_id` represents the department
    identifier.

-   In total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from
    131209 distinct users.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

-   In total, there are 134 aisles, and fresh vegetables and fresh
    fruits aisles are the most items ordered from.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, and wrangle the data.

``` r
accel_df <- 
  read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "activity"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    dow = ifelse(day %in% c('Saturday', 'Sunday'), "weekend", "weekday")
  ) %>% 
  relocate(week, day_id, day, dow)
```

Brief discription of the resulting dataset:

-   The data contains 50400 rows and 6 columns.

-   There are 7 variables in the data set: `week` represents the week
    number from 1 to 5, `day_id` shows the id of each day ranging from 1
    to 35, `day` shows what day of the week it is, `dow` shows whether
    the day is a weekday or weekend, `minite` represents every minute
    within a 24-hour day ranging from 1 to 1440, `activity` shows the
    activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at
    midnight, and its min value is `1` and max value is `8982`.

Analyses of the data focus on the total activity over the day.

``` r
total_act <- 
  accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(sum_activity = sum(activity))
```

Create a table showing the totals.

``` r
total_act %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "sum_activity"
  ) %>% 
  relocate(1, 5, 3, 7, 8, 6, 2, 4) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Total activity over a day",
    align = "l"
  )
```

| week | Sunday | Monday    | Tuesday  | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday   | Saturday |
|:-----|:-------|:----------|:---------|:----------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| 1    | 631105 | 78828.07  | 307094.2 | 340115    | 355923.6 | 480542.6 | 376254   |
| 2    | 422018 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 | 440962    | 474048.0 | 568839.0 | 607175   |
| 3    | 467052 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 | 468869    | 371230.0 | 467420.0 | 382928   |
| 4    | 260617 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 | 434460    | 340291.0 | 154049.0 | 1440     |
| 5    | 138421 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 | 445366    | 549658.0 | 620860.0 | 1440     |

Total activity over a day

Plot the data to see if there is a trend:

``` r
total_act %>% 
  mutate(
    day = factor(day, levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'))
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = sum_activity, group = week, color = week)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

![](p8105_hw3_jt3387_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

-   From the chart, we can see that the total activity count in five
    weeks has been fluctuating, and the fluctuations in the forth and
    fifth weeks are relatively greater. Overall, the total activity
    number on weekends is relatively lower than on weekdays.

Make a plot to shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  mutate(hour = minute / 60) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = activity, color = day)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(
    x = "Hours",
    y = "Activity",
    title = "24-hour activity time courses"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw3_jt3387_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

-   From the plot, we can see that the activity counts are much lower
    from 11:00 pm to 5:00 am in the midnight and early morning,
    whichcorresponds to the sleep time, and the high activity counts are
    concentrated from 9:00 am to 12:00 am and 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm. Then
    a moderate activity counts appears from 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm.

## Problem 3

Load and summary the dataset.

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>% 
  mutate(tmin = as.numeric(tmin), 
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax)) %>% 
  as_tibble(ny_noaa)
summary(ny_noaa)
```
